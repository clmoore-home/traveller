Design notes for the traveller automated planet decoder.

A user will be able to enter any planet code from a sector map and retrieve all the information contained in the code about
tech level, law levels etc. The input is the planet code, plus options for the little pictures and the initial code e.g. A-C.

This app will use a GUI interface - tkinter.

Refactoring Notes:
- Convert the app to MVC organisation - the model (planet and data), view (interface), and controller.
- Convert naming to follow the traveller nomenclature
- Convert the planetary aspects to descriptor classes.
